Many PC applications have separate menus for selecting
typeface families and typeface styles. Most applications
let you choose among regular, bold, and italic styles in
the Style menu. However, some Adobe Type Library packages
include font software with additional style variations and
stroke weight variations. To select these variations, you
need to know how the bold and italic styles are linked to
the base typeface. For example, the New Caledonia typeface
includes semi-bold, bold, and black. To use New Caledonia
Black, you need to choose New Caledonia SemiBold from the
application's Font menu(or equivalent), and then choose
Bold from the Style menu(or equivalent).

If you are using a Microsoft Windows application, Ventura
Publisher or Microsoft Word, follow the guide to typeface
style selection below. If you are using an application
other than these, refer to the application's documentation.
